# DistanceMonitoring
This is an OpenCV application where I have monitored the distance between myself and my laptop to be conscious about my posture. I have suffered from convergence insufficiency because of continuous eposure to my laptop, therefore I got this idea to ensure that I become more aware of how I work.

Libraries used:
1) Opencv
2) pygetwindow
